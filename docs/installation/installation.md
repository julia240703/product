# Code Structure

Understanding the code structure of Project Name is essential for effectively contributing to, maintaining, or customizing the software. This section provides an overview of the main directories and components in the codebase.

## Directory Overview

The codebase of Project Name follows a modular structure to promote separation of concerns and maintainability. Here's an overview of the main directories:

- `app`: Contains the core application logic, including models, controllers, and services.
- `config`: Houses configuration files for various components such as database connections and application settings.
- `database`: Includes migration files and seeders for database setup and population.
- `resources`: Holds assets, views, and frontend components like CSS, JavaScript, and Blade templates.
- `routes`: Defines the application's routes, including web and API routes.
- `tests`: Contains test suites and unit tests for automated testing.
- `public`: Serves as the web server's document root, containing publicly accessible files like images and compiled assets.

## Key Components

### Models

Models, located in the `app` directory, represent database tables and interact with data. They define relationships and perform data validation.

### Controllers

Controllers in the `app/Http/Controllers` directory handle incoming HTTP requests and interact with models to retrieve and manipulate data.

### Views

Views, located in the `resources/views` directory, contain the HTML templates that determine the presentation of web pages.

### Routes

Routes are defined in the `routes` directory, with web routes in `web.php` and API routes in `api.php`. Routes map URLs to controller actions.

### Migrations

Migrations, found in the `database/migrations` directory, define changes to the database schema. They're used for creating and modifying tables.

### Tests

The `tests` directory contains PHPUnit test suites that help ensure the correctness of the application's functionalities.

## Customization and Contribution

Understanding the code structure empowers you to customize and contribute to Project Name effectively. Feel free to explore each directory to gain a deeper understanding of the application's architecture.

For detailed information about specific functions, methods, or features, refer to the code comments and documentation throughout the codebase.

For more information on using Project Name's features, please refer to the [User Manual](../manual/admin/README.md).

By grasping the code structure, you'll be better equipped to enhance, debug, and build upon Project Name.
